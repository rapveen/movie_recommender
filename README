Implemented a recommender system for movie
recommendations. It allows a user to select his choices from a given set of
dataset and then recommend him a movie list based on the similarities
between the test movie and all the other movies present in the dataset using
the cosine simulator function. By the nature of our system, it is not an easy
task to evaluate the performance since there is no right or wrong
recommendation; it is just a matter of opinions. Having a larger
data set that will enable more meaningful results using the system.

Different machine learning and clustering algorithms have been implemented and studied the comparative results.
